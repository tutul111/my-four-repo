    <h3>Active</h3>
    <p>HBS Online courses are nothing like a typical sit-back-and-listen lecture. You’ll engage in a new activity every three to five minutes. Each element is designed to keep you interested, involved, and on your toes.</p>
    <h3>Social</h3>
    <p>Engaging with your peers is a big part of what makes HBS Online unique. You exchange ideas, offer input, and seek out viewpoints from a community of learners gathered from around the globe. In the process, you learn from each other’s experiences and perspectives.</p>
    <h3>Case-Based</h3>
    <p>Immerse yourself in real-world learning. Lessons are brought to life through cases, which put you in the shoes of business leaders. Hear firsthand the challenges they faced, and wrestle with the same issues and imperfect information.
